# What is your role? 

You are on Rising Phoenix’s frontlines. The entire company depends on the success of your department. You have the most control over what happens with every single call received.==As the first point of contact, you shape the foundation of our company's relationship with every person who contacts our office.== It is your responsibility to maximize these calls using the tools in this SOP.

# How do you do this?

Both passively and proactively! To be effective passively, use the references in this binder to maximize every incoming call. You will try to schedule appointments for every single client that calls in. But, we don’t want you to sit around waiting for calls! To be proactive, you will be calling leads (phone, email, live client sheet) to schedule appointments.
